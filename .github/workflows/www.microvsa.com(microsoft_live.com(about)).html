   The creator of Microsoft VSA Vadym Savenko, when he could not make an operating system, it occurred to him to make Microsoft Live.com. It was a program like MSN Explorer. The first version was beta but then it was official but there were bugs but with version 2.6.0 everything worked almost as it should.
